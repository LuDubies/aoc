My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

Started in 2022 with python, mostly playing around list comprehensions.
Python solutions should be relatively clean.

Some solutions in Rust (maybe more coming), to learn the language.
These propably don't look pretty.

Solutions for prev years (before 22) will probably feature some other languages to
learn or improve.

Some solutions feature clean code, others will be a quick hack. Maybe will distinguish these somehow later.
